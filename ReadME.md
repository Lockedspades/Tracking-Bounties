# OP Bounty Tracker

Second try at making this. just for review and fun. First time i started in the wrong order and had to restart. I started with making a json file and then went back and make a repo for the website. website wasnt loading properly and im not experienced enough yet to know how to fix it. I decided to redo the whole process and take it a step at a time. main goal is just to get my first website done and build it as the phases go. Id also like to start a new topic each phase to reinforce the process of build through github.
